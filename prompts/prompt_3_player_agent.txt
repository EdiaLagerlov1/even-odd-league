Implement a Player Agent HTTP server for Even/Odd game using Python FastAPI.

REQUIREMENTS:
- HTTP servers on localhost:8101-8104 (configurable port), endpoint /mcp
- Handle JSON-RPC 2.0 POST requests
- Register with League Manager
- Participate in games by making strategic choices
- Track personal game history

CORE FUNCTIONALITY:

1. PLAYER REGISTRATION
   - Send LEAGUE_REGISTER_REQUEST to league_manager (http://localhost:8000/mcp)
   - Include metadata: {"display_name": "Player X", "strategy": "random", "agent_endpoint": "http://localhost:810X/mcp"}
   - Store received player_id and auth_token from response

2. RECEIVE ANNOUNCEMENTS
   - Listen for ROUND_ANNOUNCEMENT from league_manager
   - Store upcoming matches from schedule
   - Listen for LEAGUE_STANDINGS_UPDATE to track current rankings
   - Listen for LEAGUE_COMPLETED to see final results

3. JOIN GAMES
   - Receive GAME_INVITATION from referee
   - Send GAME_JOIN_ACK to confirm participation
   - Store match_id and opponent information

4. MAKE CHOICES
   - Receive CHOOSE_PARITY_CALL from referee
   - Choose "even" or "odd" based on strategy
   - Send CHOOSE_PARITY_RESPONSE within timeout (30 seconds)

5. RECEIVE RESULTS
   - Receive GAME_OVER from referee
   - Update internal statistics (wins/losses/draws)
   - Log game results

STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATIONS:

Random Strategy:
```python
import random
def choose_parity():
    return random.choice(["even", "odd"])
```

Alternating Strategy:
```python
def choose_parity(last_choice):
    return "odd" if last_choice == "even" else "even"
```

History-Based Strategy:
```python
def choose_parity(history):
    # Count recent outcomes
    even_wins = sum(1 for h in history if h['winner_choice'] == 'even')
    odd_wins = sum(1 for h in history if h['winner_choice'] == 'odd')
    return "even" if even_wins >= odd_wins else "odd"
```

MESSAGE STRUCTURE:
{
  "protocol": "league.v2",
  "message_type": "<TYPE>",
  "sender": "player:P01",
  "timestamp": "<ISO 8601 UTC>",
  "conversation_id": "<unique_id>",
  "auth_token": "<token>",
  ... specific fields ...
}

PLAYER FLOW:
1. Register with league_manager
2. Wait for ROUND_ANNOUNCEMENT
3. Receive GAME_INVITATION from referee
4. Send GAME_JOIN_ACK
5. Receive CHOOSE_PARITY_CALL
6. Send CHOOSE_PARITY_RESPONSE with choice
7. Receive GAME_OVER with results
8. Repeat for next matches
9. Receive LEAGUE_COMPLETED when league ends

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Use FastAPI for HTTP server
- Use requests library for HTTP POST to other agents
- Accept port number as command-line argument
- Log all messages to JSON Lines file
- Maintain game history: [{match_id, opponent, my_choice, opponent_choice, number, result}]
- Track personal statistics: {wins, losses, draws, total_games}
- Generate ISO 8601 UTC timestamps
- Include auth_token in all outgoing requests
- Respond to CHOOSE_PARITY_CALL within 30 seconds

CONFIGURABLE PARAMETERS:
- player_display_name: Command-line argument or config
- port: Command-line argument (default 8101)
- strategy: "random", "alternating", or "history" (command-line argument)

STARTUP SEQUENCE:
1. Start HTTP server on specified port
2. Wait 2 seconds for server to be ready
3. Register with league_manager
4. Wait for messages
