Implement a League Manager HTTP server for an Even/Odd game league system using Python FastAPI.

REQUIREMENTS:
- HTTP server on localhost:8000, endpoint /mcp
- Handle JSON-RPC 2.0 POST requests
- Manage referee and player registrations
- Create match schedules and manage rounds
- Track standings and statistics

CORE FUNCTIONALITY:

1. REFEREE REGISTRATION
   - Receive REFEREE_REGISTER_REQUEST from referees
   - Generate unique referee_id and auth_token
   - Store referee metadata (display_name, version)
   - Return REFEREE_REGISTER_RESPONSE with referee_id and auth_token

2. PLAYER REGISTRATION
   - Receive LEAGUE_REGISTER_REQUEST from players  
   - Generate unique player_id and auth_token
   - Store player metadata (display_name, agent_endpoint, strategy)
   - Return LEAGUE_REGISTER_RESPONSE with player_id and auth_token

3. SCHEDULE CREATION
   - Create round-robin schedule for all registered players
   - Assign referee to each match
   - Generate unique match_id for each game

4. ROUND MANAGEMENT
   - Send ROUND_ANNOUNCEMENT to all players with schedule
   - Track match completion
   - Send ROUND_COMPLETED when all matches finish

5. STANDINGS UPDATE
   - Receive MATCH_RESULT_REPORT from referee
   - Update player wins/losses/draws
   - Send LEAGUE_STANDINGS_UPDATE to all players

6. LEAGUE COMPLETION
   - Send LEAGUE_COMPLETED when all rounds finish
   - Include final standings with winner

7. QUERY HANDLING
   - Process LEAGUE_QUERY requests (GET_STANDINGS, GET_SCHEDULE, GET_NEXT_MATCH, GET_PLAYER_STATS)
   - Return LEAGUE_QUERY_RESPONSE with requested data

MESSAGE STRUCTURE (all messages):
{
  "protocol": "league.v2",
  "message_type": "<TYPE>",
  "sender": "league_manager",
  "timestamp": "<ISO 8601 UTC>",
  "conversation_id": "<unique_id>",
  ... specific fields ...
}

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Use FastAPI for HTTP server
- Validate auth_token on incoming requests
- Log all messages to JSON Lines file (one JSON object per line)
- Handle timeouts and errors gracefully
- Store state in memory (dict/dataclass structures)
- Generate ISO 8601 UTC timestamps
- Return proper HTTP status codes (200 for success, 400/500 for errors)

DATA STRUCTURES:
- Registry of referees: {referee_id: {metadata, auth_token, endpoint}}
- Registry of players: {player_id: {metadata, auth_token, endpoint, wins, losses, draws}}
- Schedule: list of matches {match_id, round_id, player1_id, player2_id, referee_id, status}
- Current round tracking
