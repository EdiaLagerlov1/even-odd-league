Implement a Referee HTTP server for managing Even/Odd games using Python FastAPI.

REQUIREMENTS:
- HTTP server on localhost:8001, endpoint /mcp
- Handle JSON-RPC 2.0 POST requests
- Register with League Manager
- Manage individual game sessions
- Enforce game rules and determine winners

CORE FUNCTIONALITY:

1. REFEREE REGISTRATION
   - Send REFEREE_REGISTER_REQUEST to league_manager (http://localhost:8000/mcp)
   - Include metadata: {"display_name": "Referee Alpha", "version": "2.0"}
   - Store received referee_id and auth_token from response

2. GAME INVITATION
   - Receive match assignment from league manager
   - Send GAME_INVITATION to both players
   - Wait for GAME_JOIN_ACK from both players
   - Track game state: WAITING_FOR_PLAYERS → COLLECTING_CHOICES → COMPLETED

3. COLLECT CHOICES
   - Send CHOOSE_PARITY_CALL to each player
   - Collect CHOOSE_PARITY_RESPONSE from players
   - Validate choices are "even" or "odd"
   - Handle timeouts (30 seconds per player response)

4. DETERMINE WINNER
   - Generate random number (1-100)
   - Check if number is even or odd
   - Determine winner based on matching choice
   - Handle draw if both choose same and neither matches

5. GAME COMPLETION
   - Send GAME_OVER to both players with results
   - Include: winner_id, number_drawn, p1_choice, p2_choice
   - Send MATCH_RESULT_REPORT to league_manager

6. ERROR HANDLING
   - Send GAME_ERROR for timeouts, invalid choices, disconnections
   - Implement retry logic (max 3 retries)
   - Award technical loss if player fails to respond after retries

MESSAGE STRUCTURE:
{
  "protocol": "league.v2",
  "message_type": "<TYPE>",
  "sender": "referee:REF01",
  "timestamp": "<ISO 8601 UTC>",
  "conversation_id": "<unique_id>",
  "match_id": "<match_id>",
  ... specific fields ...
}

GAME FLOW:
1. Receive match assignment from league manager
2. Send GAME_INVITATION → receive GAME_JOIN_ACK (both players)
3. Send CHOOSE_PARITY_CALL → receive CHOOSE_PARITY_RESPONSE (both players)
4. Generate random number (random.randint(1, 100))
5. Determine winner: if number % 2 == 0 then "even" wins, else "odd" wins
6. Send GAME_OVER to players
7. Send MATCH_RESULT_REPORT to league_manager

EVEN/ODD RULES:
- Each player chooses "even" or "odd"
- Referee draws random number (1-100)
- If number is even (number % 2 == 0): player who chose "even" wins
- If number is odd (number % 2 == 1): player who chose "odd" wins
- Draw if both players choose the same option

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Use FastAPI for HTTP server
- Use requests library for HTTP POST to other agents
- Log all messages to JSON Lines file
- Track game state machine: WAITING_FOR_PLAYERS → COLLECTING_CHOICES → DETERMINING_WINNER → COMPLETED
- Implement 30-second timeout for player responses
- Generate unique conversation_id for each match
- Send auth_token in all requests
